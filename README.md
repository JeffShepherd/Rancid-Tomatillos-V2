# Rancid Tomatillos V2

This project is an effort to practice refactoring. The original project was completing while I was just learning React.

The old project ReadMe is listed below for reference, and will be removed upon completion of the refactoring.

## Overview

This project is definitely not Rotten Tomatoes. Nor is it Netflix. Nor is it IMDB. Itâ€™s R A N C I D T O M A T I L L O S. Very different!

_Rancid Tomatillos_ is a [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) Module 3 paired project. The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic application that leverages an API to receive, and display, movie data. A user can search and filter a long list of movies, as well as view detailed information about a specific movie by clicking on it. To create this application, we leveraged React, React Router, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create the front-end. As we worked, we used Cypress for test-driven development of our application.




## Planning Resources

* [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/JeffShepherd/Rancid-Tomatillos/projects/1)
* [Miro Board - Wireframes and Component Structure](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lNxtxTk=/)


## Setup Instructions


Clone down this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:JeffShepherd/Rancid-Tomatillos.git
```

Then install the library dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

To start application, run:

```
npm start
```

If you see `Compiled successfully!` in your terminal, the application is running and the app can be veiwed at `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.



## Learning Goals

* Gain competency with React fundamentals
* Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JavaScript
* Practice refactoring
* Create a multi-page UX using Router

## Challenges

* New technologies! React, Router, and Cypress were new concepts to us before this project
* Component architecture, and deciding which components should hold state
* Running into a late issue with a user flow we never considered
* Ensuring we prioritize our learning over adding more features to this application


---
## Wins


* Learning, and leveraging, multiple new technologies in a short amount of time
* Utilizing new features of React Router to solve a challenging navigation issue
* Optimizing performance of the aplication via architecture changes, API data scrubbing, and destructuring of objects
* Ensuring we prioritize our learning over adding more features to this application


---
## Future Iterations

* Deploy and use [our own Express app](https://github.com/JeffShepherd/movie-API/tree/main) for the endpoints holding the data we fetch.
* Refactor the application, and our API, to allow a user to favorite a movie, and view their favorites at a later date.
* Refactor `Form` to render two separate components: `Sort` and `Search`.
* Add a link to the details page to display the movie trailer in a modal element.
